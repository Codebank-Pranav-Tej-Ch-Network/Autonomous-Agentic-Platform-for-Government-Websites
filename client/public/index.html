      THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THIS FILE!
      
      This div with id="root" is where your entire React application
      will be rendered. When React starts up, it looks for an element
      with this exact ID and mounts your App component inside it.
      
      Everything you see in your application - every button, every form,
      every piece of text - will be injected into this div by React's
      JavaScript code. Right now it's empty, but once React loads,
      it becomes your entire application.
      
      Think of this as a blank canvas that React will paint on.
    -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    
    <!--
      You don't see any <script> tags here importing your JavaScript
      because Create React App (react-scripts) automatically injects
      them during the build process. The build tool knows to bundle
      all your JavaScript and insert the appropriate script tags here.
      
      This is part of the "magic" that Create React App provides -
      you don't have to manually manage script tags and bundling.
